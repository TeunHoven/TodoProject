# Todo Project

This is a small personal project of mine to learn Django. The project consists of the following pages:
- Home page
- Todo-List page (all the lists with the todo)
- Todo page (the actual todos of a list)

This website is made using Django to handle the back-end and I used Bootstrap to make it visually pleasing, I am not a front-end developer thus this is the best I can do :)
